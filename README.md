# Playlister

Welcome to Playlister, the website that lets you listen to music the way you want to.

Includes a normal shuffle, a psuedo-random shuffle, front to back, and back to front playback.

Incorporates a doubly linked list for front to back and back to front playback, and incorporates a graph and heap for the psuedo-random shuffle. The regular shuffle uses the Fisher-Yates algorithm.

Allows for the user to log into their Spotify account to access their playlists, but a set of preselected playlists are also provided.
