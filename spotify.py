# TODO

# [x] reload new token on an interval
# [x] pop up window for random playlist
# [x] random playlist to show 10 playlists with 50-100 tracks

# [x] for the longest playlist, we need to implement a for loop to 
#     keep loading in 100 songs; we need to implement an offset value
#     as well, and also every 10 requests we should generate a new token

# [x] doubly linked list for forward / backward playback
# [x] create LL based off original order of playlist
# [ ] to play forward, go from head->next until next is None        # is still array-based, look to change
# [ ] to play backward, go from tail->next until next is None       # is still array-based, look to change
